      summary="
        <p>
          Sol LeWitt (American, 1928â€“2007) executed drawings by hand throughout his life;
          in 1968 he extricated his work from the confines of the frame and transferred it
          directly to the wall. The wall compositions were designed for limited duration and maximum
          flexibility within a broad range of architectural settings. Initially executed by drafters,
          these works in their finished state were most often slated for destruction. A seminal
          practitioner of Conceptual Art, LeWitt emphasized the creative idea that generates a work
          of art, as opposed to the work's material existence. &#8220;For each work of art that becomes
          physical,&#8221; he wrote, &#8220;there are many variations that do not.&#8221;

          Sol LeWitt's 1982 Wall Drawing #370: Ten Geometric Figures (including right triangle,
          cross, X, diamond) with three-inch parallel bands of lines in two directions was installed
          at the Museum over a period of four weeks. The drawing will be on view in its complete state
          through January 28, 2018, when it will be painted over.
